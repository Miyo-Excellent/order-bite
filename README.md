# Virtual Restaurant Menu
This project is a simple webpage that functions as a virtual menu for a restaurant. It allows diners to navigate the menu and place orders virtually. The goal is to provide a comfortable and efficient experience for both the customer and restaurant staff.

## Requirements
As a restaurant diner, the following requirements can be made:

 - Have a menu or navigation bar with at least 3 types of appetizers.
 - When selecting an appetizer type, at least 3 different options should be displayed. For example, for main courses, the options may be meat, special rice, fish, etc.
 - Each dish should contain a "View More" button that shows more details, such as the price and a description.
 - There should be an indicator with a counter that shows the number of dishes selected. Clicking on the counter should display a list of the selected dishes and their total cost.
To achieve these requirements, Vanilla JavaScript or a SPA in Vite + React is suggested. In addition, the use of tools such as TypeScript, React Router, Redux Toolkit, CSS frameworks, and testing are optional.

## Grading Criteria
The project will be graded on the following aspects:
 1. Ability to propose a solution with design freedom.
 2. Use of State Management (Redux Toolkit).
 3. Use of Router (React Router).
 4. Reactivity handling.
 5. Lifecycle handling.
 6. Best practices.
The developer is expected to demonstrate their skills and knowledge in these areas and follow best practices in implementing the project.
